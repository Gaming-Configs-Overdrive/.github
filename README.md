## 🚀 Mission

**Gaming-Configs-Overdrive** is dedicated to collecting, maintaining, and improving configuration files for PC games of all kinds.  
Our goal is simple:  
To make it **easy for every gamer** to find or share the **best possible setup** for performance, visuals, and control.

## 🧩 What You’ll Find

- 🎯 **Game Config Repositories** — community-tuned `.cfg`, `.ini`, `.json`, or launcher setups  
- ⚙️ **Engine Tweaks & Presets** — optimized settings for popular engines (Source, Unreal, Unity, Frostbite …)  
- 🧠 **Knowledge Sharing** — explanations, performance metrics, and compatibility notes  
- 🛠️ **Utility Scripts** — helpers to automate config deployment or testing  

Each repository focuses on one game and follows a common structure to keep everything clean and discoverable.

## 🧰 Template for New Configs

To keep things consistent, all new repositories should be based on our official template:

👉 [**Config Template Repository**](https://github.com/Gaming-Configs-Overdrive/game-config-skeleton)

It includes:
- a standardized folder layout (`/configs`, `/docs`, `/mods`)
- a `README.md` template for game-specific information
- contribution and naming guidelines

Simply click **“Use this template”** when creating a new repo inside the organization.
